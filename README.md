## ðŸ§ª GitHub Advanced Security POC
This fork demonstrates CodeQL scanning on pull requests for OWASP Juice Shop.
The goal is to surface vulnerabilities directly in PR checks without navigating to the Security tab.

### Steps
Under .github/workflow
- added `codeql-bhpoc.yml` for code scanning
- added `dependency-review.yml` for dependency review 
Display code scanning results as PR annotations (no need to open the Security tab)

### Reference Branch
The initial baseline code is available in `feature/initialcode`.
